Ex 7, Markov Reward Process: Write a function in Python that can generate an episode for the student MRP example. Each episode should include states and rewards. Use your function to generate three episodes, and append the results as comments following your code.

Ex 8, Markov Decision Process: Write a function in Python that can generate an episode for the student MDP example under a given policy. Each episode should include states, actions, and rewards. Then use your function to generate three episodes under the random policy. Paste results as comments in your code. 
Note: for simplicity, we will assume that there are only two possible actions: Study and Relax (i.e., Facebook, Pub, or Sleep).
