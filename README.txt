In this repository, you will find implementations of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms and their applications to optimization problems. This repo grew out of a graduate course in Reinforcement Learning at University of Virginia. A list of algorithm implementations and their applications is given below:

HW1:
MRP (Markov Reward Process),
MDP (Markov Decision Process).

HW2:
Policy iteration algorithm: policy evaluation and policy improvement,
Dynamic Programming,
Value iteration algorithm applied to the gambler’s problem, 
value iteration algorithm applied to car rental optimization.

HW3:
Monte Carlo every-visit policy evaluation algorithm,
TD(0) algorithm applied to random walk,
n-step TD algorithm applied to large random walk,
TD(λ) (both backward view and forward view) algorithms.

HW4:
Monte Carlo ES (Exploring Starts) algorithm, applied on Black Jack,
Sarsa algorithm, applied on windy gridworld,
Sarsa(λ) algorithm, applied on windy gridworld. 

HW5:
Q-learning,
Maximization Bias and Double-Q Learning.
