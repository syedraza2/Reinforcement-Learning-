Textbook: Reinforcement Learning, Second Edition
By Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto

5. Implement the Monte Carlo every-visit policy evaluation algorithm (with incremen- tal updating). Complete MC eVisit.py. Then run blackjack prediction.py with num episode = 10,000 and 500,000 to test your code on the blackjack example. You should have figures similar to Figure 5.1 in the textbook. Submit the two figures and MC eVisit.py. 

6. Implement the TD(0) algorithm. Complete function TD0 in TD.py. Then run rw.py to test your code on the random walk example (Example 6.2 in the textbook). Submit the two figures generated from this run. 

7. Implement the n-step TD algorithm. Complete function TD n in TD.py. Run rw nstepTD.py to test your code on the large random walk example, i.e., Example 7.1 in the textbook. You should have a figure similar to (part of) Figure 7.2 in the textbook. 

8. Implement the TD(Î») (backward view) algorithm. Complete function TD lambda in TD.py. Run rw TDlambda.py to test your code on the large random walk example. Your figure should be similar to the left one in Figure 12.6 in the textbook. Submit this figure, and the complete TD.py.
